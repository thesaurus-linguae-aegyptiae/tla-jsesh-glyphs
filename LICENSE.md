The glyph SVGs in this repository are often based on model from the JSesh Glyph library, notably those made by S.J.P. Thomas (see https://jsesh.qenherkhopeshef.org/glyphs).

S.J.P. Thomas, the original author of the glyphs allows for the following usages:
- It is ok to **use the hieroglyph SVGs in JSesh** (https://jsesh.qenherkhopeshef.org/).
- It is ok to distribute the hieroglyph SVGs as part of the JSesh glyph library.
- It is ok to **use the hieroglyph SVGs for publications** (paper, databases, web sites).
- It is ok to **modify the hieroglyph SVGs for the same purposes**.

However,
- It is **_not allowed_ to use the hieroglyph SVGs in/for other hieroglyphic word processors than with JSesh**.

For the time being, the same rules apply for the glyph SVGs build by the TLA team.
